# 100DaysOfML
This repository is part of 100 days of ML. I am taking up the challenge to to Learn Machine Learning at least an hour everyday!!
This one hour can be studying or coding the machine learning realted topics.

Challenge is starting from June 06 2018.

### Day 0: July 05 2018: 

### Setup:
I have setup all the thing needed to complete the challenge. 

Tools and Technologies I am planning to use : 

* Anconda, Python, Juypter Notebook
* Libraries : Sci-Kit Learn, Tensorflow
* Data visualization: D3.js , Matplotlib

I have installed all the libraries and IDE needed for to take this challenge.


### Day 1: July 06 2018: 

### Classification :
 Today I want to work on MNIST dataset. This dataset is a set of 70000 sall images of digits handwritten by high school and employees of the US Census Board. 

Today I did :
* Importing Dataset
* Visualizing the Data
* Splitting Training and Testing 
* Training a Binary Classifier

Classification on MNIST dataset can found [here](https://github.com/rohith28/Classification)

### Day 2 : July 07 2018

### Classification :
In conituation to the above classification:

* Performance Measure 
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision and Recall
* Precision/Recall tradeoff
* ROC Curve


Classification on MNIST dataset can found [here](https://github.com/rohith28/Classification)

### Day 3 : July 08 2018
### Classification

* In past two days I learned 
  * how to train binary classifier
  * choosing metrics for the task
  * Evaluating the classifiers using Cross validation
  * Selecting Precision/ Recall tradeoff
  * Compare models using ROC curves and ROC AUC scores

Today I want to work on :
* Multiclass classification
* Error Analysis
* Multilabel Classification
* Multioutput Classification

### Day 4 : July 09 2018
### Linear Regression
